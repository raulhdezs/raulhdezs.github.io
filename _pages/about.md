Raúl Hernández holds a [B.S. in Industrial Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/industrial-technologies) (2017) and a [M.S. in Industrial Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/master/industrial-engineering) (2019) from the [University Carlos III of Madrid](https://uc3m.es). As an undergraduate research fellow, he worked under the supervision of [Prof. César Huete](http://fluidosuc3m.es/people/chuete/), studying numerically the shock wave ignition of hydrogen/air mixing layers.

Then, he moved to the [Institute for Non-Equilibrium Phenomena Research (IRPHE)](https://irphe.univ-amu.fr/) in Marseille, where he studied the direct initiation of gaseous detonations and the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) using a combination of asymptotic and numerical methods. In 2023, he obtained a [Ph.D. in Mechanics and Physics of Fluids](https://ecole-doctorale-353.univ-amu.fr/) from [Aix-Marseille University](https://www.univ-amu.fr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Bruno Denet](https://www.irphe.fr/~denet/) and [Prof. Paul Clavin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Clavin).

He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at University Carlos III of Madrid. He works with [Prof. Mario Sánchez](http://fluidosuc3m.es/people/mssanz/) in the experimental analysis of flashback and blow off limits of hydrogen/ammonia/air premixed flames and with [Prof. César Huete](http://fluidosuc3m.es/people/chuete/) and [Prof. Daniel Martínez](https://blogs.upm.es/labcmf/people/#) in the modelling and numerical analysis of spray detonations.
