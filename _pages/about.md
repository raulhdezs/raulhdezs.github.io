Raúl Hernández holds a B.S. in Industrial Engineering (2017) and a M.S. in Industrial Engineering (2019) from the University Carlos III of Madrid. As an undergraduate research fellow, he worked under the supervision of Prof. César Huete, studying numerically the shock wave ignition of hydrogen/air mixing layers.

Then, he moved to the Institute for Non-Equilibrium Phenomena Research (IRPHE) in Marseille, where he studied the direct initiation of gaseous detonations and the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) using a combination of asymptotic and numerical methods. In 2023, he obtained a Ph.D. in Mechanics and Physics of Fluids from Aix-Marseille University under the supervision of Prof. Bruno Denet and Prof. Paul Clavin.

He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at University Carlos III of Madrid. He works with Prof. Mario Sánchez in the experimental analysis of flashback and blow off limits of hydrogen/ammonia/air premixed flames and with Prof. César Huete and Prof. Daniel Martínez in the modelling and numerical analysis of spray detonations.
