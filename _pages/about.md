### Bio

Hi! I’m Raúl Hernández, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M)](https://www.uc3m.es). My academic journey began with a [B.S. in Industrial Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/industrial-technologies) (2017) and a [M.S. in Industrial Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/master/industrial-engineering) (2019) from UC3M. During my graduate studies, I also received complementary training in [Perturbation Methods and Combustion](https://www.m2i.es/), and began my research work with [Prof. César Huete](http://fluidosuc3m.es/people/chuete/) by numerically studying shock wave ignition in reactive mixture layers.

After that, I moved to Marseille to join the [Institute for Non-Equilibrium Phenomena Research (IRPHE)](https://irphe.univ-amu.fr/). There, I explored the direct initiation of gaseous detonations and the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT), using both asymptotic and numerical methods. In 2023, I completed my [Ph.D. in Mechanics and Physics of Fluids](https://ecole-doctorale-353.univ-amu.fr/) at [Aix-Marseille University](https://www.univ-amu.fr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Bruno Denet](https://www.irphe.fr/~denet/) and [Prof. Paul Clavin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Clavin).

Currently, back at UC3M, I'm working with [Prof. Mario Sánchez](http://fluidosuc3m.es/people/mssanz/) on experimental research into flashback and blow-off limits in hydrogen/ammonia/air premixed flames. I'm also collaborating with [Prof. César Huete](http://fluidosuc3m.es/people/chuete/) and [Prof. Daniel Martínez](https://blogs.upm.es/labcmf/people/#) in modelling and numerical analyzing spray detonations.

### Research Interests

My research focuses on understanding unsteady combustion phenomena that are key to safely using carbon-free fuels. I combine theory, numerical analysis and experimental studies to guide this work.

### Teaching Activities

During my PhD at IRPHE, I balanced research with teaching at [Polytech Marseille](https://polytech.univ-amu.fr/fr/formations/cycle-ingenieur/mecanique-energetique) and [IUT Aix-Marseille Université](https://iut.univ-amu.fr/fr/formations/bachelor-universitaire-de-technologie/but-metiers-transition-efficacite-energetiques), where I taught several courses in energy and mechanics. Currently, I teach [Fluid Mechanics](https://aplicaciones.uc3m.es/cpa/generaFicha?est=256&plan=418&asig=15499&idioma=2) to students in Aerospace, Mechanics, and Industrial Engineering programs, and I also supervise Master's theses.
